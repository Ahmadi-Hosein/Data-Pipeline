This workflow outlines the complete process for selecting and preparing CMIP6 climate data for hydrologic impact analysis. It includes:

Downloading CMIP6 data from [the ESGF data portal or equivalent web-based source.](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6)

Bias correction of raw GCM outputs using historical observations to improve local accuracy.

Model evaluation and ranking based on statistical and climate performance metrics.

Selection of top-performing models suited to the study region and variable of interest.

Construction of an ensemble from selected models to account for uncertainty and provide a robust climate projection.

This workflow ensures scientifically defensible use of CMIP6 projections in climate-resilient water resource modeling and planning.
